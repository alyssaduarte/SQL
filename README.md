# Howdy! 🤠 
## I'm a Texas-based data enthusiast who loves turning raw data into real insights. Here you'll find a collection of SQL projects where I transform complex datasets into clear, actionable findings. I enjoy solving problems, making data tell a story, and keeping things simple but effective.

Take a look around -- hope you find something interesting!
